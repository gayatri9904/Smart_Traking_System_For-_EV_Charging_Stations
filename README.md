Smart Tracking System for EV Charging Stations is a web-based application that helps electric vehicle users easily locate charging stations, plan efficient routes with charging stops, and check traffic conditions. The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrates Maps APIs for real-time location, routing, EV station search, and traffic data.

Key Features:

1] Search charging stations by location/area
2] Plan routes with charging stations, travel distance, and battery usage
3] Check traffic by selecting an area with a boundary box
4] Interactive map-based interface

This project aims to reduce range anxiety, improve travel planning, and support the adoption of sustainable EV infrastructure.
